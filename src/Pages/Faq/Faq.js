          Does my site need to be updated to HTTPS instead of HTTP?
        </strong>
        <small>
          Yes! In 2018, there is no reason – no good excuse – not to upgrade any
          site to HTTPS by acquiring an SSL certificate. Starting in August
          2018, the most popular web browser on the planet, Google Chrome, will
          give a big red warning to your visitors if your site is not fully
          secure. Firefox is already doing this, and Microsoft’s Edge and
          Apple’s Safari are sure to follow. So make sure you get an SSL
          certificate and keep it up to date. This will protect your content
          from being covertly altered and prevent your customers’ information
          from being monitored or stolen. There are dozens more reasons why
          HTTPS is vital for your website and business. Learn more on our blog
          about updating your site to SSL.

        <strong>How long does a website redesign take?</strong>
        <small>
          Depending on the size, complexity and, most critically, the client’s
          active involvement in the process, a website takes anywhere between
          six and 24 weeks to build and launch. Some incredibly large projects
          have broken the year mark. We have the team of developers and web
          designers, as well as the project management processes, in place to
          build and deliver the most friendly, accessible and speed-optimized
          websites available. The process is highly collaborative, so build
          times can vary based on how quickly clients are able to respond to
          questions or approve portions of the site that inform other parts.
          Since we adjust and readjust to achieve the best UX and the best
          representation of our clients’ vision, delays are natural as we
          process feedback and get sites just right. We want your site to
          succeed, and we are experts at doing that. Clients know their business
          and their customers, and we know marketing and design – when everybody
          sticks to their strengths and works together, we all win.

        <strong>What happens if my site breaks?</strong>
        <small>
          We’re always here to help! We can cover emergencies and
          non-emergencies alike. Just be sure to give us as many details as
          possible about the problem: the browser you were using when you
          noticed the problem, your computer’s operating system, time of day,
          what actions you were performing, what device you were using when you
          saw the problem, etc. Additionally, we can provide a maintenance
          agreement to help prevent many common site crashes from ever happening
          in the first place. That way, problems are minimized, and you can have
          peace of mind knowing that when problems do occur, you’re covered!?
